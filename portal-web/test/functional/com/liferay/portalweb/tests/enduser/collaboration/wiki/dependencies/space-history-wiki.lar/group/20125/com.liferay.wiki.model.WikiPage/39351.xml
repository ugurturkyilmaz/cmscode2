	<__content>== **A Short History of S.P.A.C.E.** ==

**Located in Provincetown, MA, S.P.A.C.E. (Space Program Academy of Continuing Education) was founded in February of 2063 by its current [[Board of Governors]] members—[[Dr. Edith Adams]], [[Dr. Harold Vance]], [[Antony Carelli]], and [[Victoria Allen]]—as a fully-accredited, internationally-run school for students interested in pursuing a wide range of space-related careers. S.P.A.C.E. also serves as a research center for faculty. S.P.A.C.E.'s foundation came about largely as a result of skyrocketing interest in space-related careers and the limitations on [[The Space Program]].**

**The Space Program**

**S.P.A.C.E. evolved from The Space Program, a mission-focused private initiative supported by 88% of world governments and the United Nations.**

**Board members have been open about drawing inspiration both from the International Space University (ISU) and the (now defunct) International Space Research Institute (ISRI) when realizing they wanted to expand The Space Program's reach.**

**"What we were doing with ~[The Space Program~] was incredibly important," said Board Member Dr. Adams, "but the scope was limited. We wanted to be at the forefront of breakthrough space technology. We didn’t just want to send people. Everybody was enthusiastic about research and about training the next generation; the program as it was only provided a certain level of training, again, very limited in scope, but useful for our purposes. But as our purposes changed, so did our vision for the future. We asked ourselves: what would it look like to provide a place where people interested in all things space—not just in going to space, but in equipping others to go—could be and thrive? And once we began talking about it, a school was the obvious solution. It answered so many of the questions we had and so much of what we wanted to do as a team."**

**Board Members had a series of meetings throughout 2061 and 2062 that solidified their plans, and in late 2062, they approached [[Dr. Asmund Grey]], formerly president of ISU, to ask if he would consider becoming president. He consented, and the four Board Members became the Board of Governors.**

**Board Member Dr. Vance describes the transition from The Space Program to S.P.A.C.E. like this: "From a business perspective, once we discussed the idea of a school, sort of a space graduate school, if you will, it really did seem like the next logical step in terms of The Space Program’s development and evolution. It was absolutely where we were headed, which is I think why so much of our staff reacted positively and why we were able to keep so many of them on."**

**Staff and Community Response**

**The new direction was met with an almost overwhelming amount of good feedback from the existing space community, the public, and the staff of The Space Program. **

**"We were very lucky," admitted Board Member Allen. "Almost all of our staff was on board with the plan, and we were able to keep about 90% of them by restructuring things a little bit and shifting job positions and job titles. The other 10% decided to pursue other opportunities with ISU or NASA or elsewhere, and that was great. I mean, we didn’t have to layoff anybody. Which I think is pretty much unheard of with a change this big."**

**Faculty Hiring Initiative**

**After a complete plan for the school was conceived and developed, Dr. Grey worked with the Board of Governors on hiring professors from around the world, offering a unique 25~/75 teaching~/research model.**

**Said Dr. Grey: "I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say that we’ve got the best of the best here ~[at S.P.A.C.E.~]. The accomplishments of our faculty are amazing, and we’re glad we can give them both a space to continue their work as well as train future leaders in space technology and exploration. We’re privileged and proud."**

**The Future of S.P.A.C.E.**

**So what's next for S.P.A.C.E.? Board Member Carelli, the public face of the Board of Governors, shared his thoughts in a January 2065 press conference.**

**"You know, ~[S.P.A.C.E.~] is young still. But already we’ve seen it become immensely successful, so much so that we had to overhaul our entire platform. We just had this huge spike in traffic and requests, and functionally—there was this sense of needing to grow as much as our vision for the program had grown, and at first we didn’t take that into account. Once we did, I mean, everything has taken off from there, and that was exactly the sort of problem we wanted to have, you know? Everybody loves Asmund ~[Grey~], and he’s really just a great leader for the school. So even though it’s still early days, I have full confidence in our success and our continued success. We’re very hopeful for the future, and it can only go up from here."**</__content>
