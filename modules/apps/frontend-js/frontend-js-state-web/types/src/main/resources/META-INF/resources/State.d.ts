	 * practical or possible to obtain a reference to a concrete atom or
	 * selector (for example, from within JSPs). These methods all take a string
	 * key and use it to look up the corresponding atom or selector.
	 *
	 * This usage is considered unsafe because it bypasses the static type
	 * checking provided by the main API (`read()`, `write()` etc). Given that
	 * the integrity of global shared state largely depends on the values being
	 * of a predictable and correct type, you should use the `__unsafe__` API
	 * only as a last resort. Instead, consider moving legacy code out of JSPs
	 * and into places where it can fully participate in the module-loading
	 * system and thus access concrete atoms and selectors by importing them. At
	 * the same time, moving legacy code into React components provides access
	 * to the `useLiferayState()` hook and other conveniences.
