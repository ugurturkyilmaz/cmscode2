/**
 * This is an interface for registering OSGi services that get notified whenever
 * the {@link NPMRegistry} is updated.
 *
 * {@link JSBundleTracker} objects can be registered with the
 * {@link NPMRegistry} calling
 * {@link NPMRegistry#addJSBundleTracker(JSBundleTracker)} or declaring them as
 * OSGi services (in that case the {@link NPMRegistry} will find and attach
 * them).
 *
 * The reason for {@link NPMRegistry#addJSBundleTracker(JSBundleTracker)} to
 * exist is that sometimes you need to implement a {@link JSBundleTracker} in a
 * service which depends on {@link NPMRegistry} and thus, you cannot declare it
 * as a {@link JSBundleTracker} because OSGi will complain about a soft circular
 * dependency.
