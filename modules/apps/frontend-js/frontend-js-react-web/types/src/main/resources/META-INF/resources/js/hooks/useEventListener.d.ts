 * Hook for adding an event listener on mount and removing it on
 * unmount.
 *
 * Note that in general you should be using React's built-in delegated
 * event handling (ie. via `onclick`, `onfocus` etc attributes). This
 * hook is for those rarer cases where you need to attach a listener
 * outside of your component's DOM (eg. attaching a "scroll" or "resize"
 * listener to the `window`).
