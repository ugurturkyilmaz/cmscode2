 * @author Alejandro Tard√≠n  Provides option labels and values for configuration

 *         values for {@link aQute.bnd.annotation.metatype.Meta.AD.optionLabels}
 *         and {@link aQute.bnd.annotation.metatype.Meta.AD.optionValues} with
 *         the benefit of doing it at runtime.  Implementations must be
 *         registered as a ConfigurationFieldOptionsProvider service, and must
 *         have the property "configuration.pid" whose value matches the ID of
 *         the corresponding configuration interface (usually the fully
 *         qualified class name) and the property "configuration.field.name"
 *         whose value matches the name of the attribute in the configuration
 *         interface.
