 * Form Provider is a "store" that is compatible with the concept of

 *
 * <FormProvider
 *  reducers={[dragAndDropReducer, fieldEditableReducer]}
 *  value={state}
 * >
 * 	...
 * </FormProvider>
 *
 * Reducers receive the extra config property in addition to state
 * and action, it is mandatory that ConfigProvider be declared
 * before FormProvider.
 *
 * <ConfigProvider>
 *  <FormProvider>
 *   ...
 *  </FormProvider>
 * </ConfigProvider>
 *
 * FormProvider is built to be composed and can be declared more
 * than once in the application to deal with the same structure in
 * some part of the application tree. The real example is Sidebar,
 * which has the same `pages` structure that needs to be manipulated
 * but is isolated from the application and the main store.
 *
 * <ConfigProvider>
 *  <FormProvider> <- Main Store
 *   <FormBuilder>
 *    <Pages/>
 *    <Sidebar>
 *     <FormProvider> <- Isolated state
 *      <Pages />
