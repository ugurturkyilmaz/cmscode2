liferay-releng-app-description=The Liferay REST APIs app exposes a new breed of RESTful APIs that interact with Liferay services. These APIs let developers consume Liferay services in a straightforward and flexible way. For example, developers can consume portal resources like documents, blogs, or structured content via fully RESTful APIs that support several response formats like JSON or XML. <br /><br />This app has no visual component in the portal. After installing it, you can begin accessing the APIs in the corresponding URLs that you can check via http://[host]:[port]/o/api. (Automatic Copy)
