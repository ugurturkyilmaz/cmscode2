## API Method Signatures

The following types should be avoided in API method signatures:

**`HttpServletRequest`**, **`HttpServletResponse`**, **`ThemeDisplay`**, and
**`ServiceContext`**.

These are very loosely typed classes, since they can contain any object as
attributes or parameters. By using it as a parameter for a method in the API,
any user will have to rely on documentation to know how the request should be
populated. It also makes the API harder to test or debug.

Instead, pass the specific parameters attributes as method parameters. When
appropriate group them in a bean with highly cohesive fields.
