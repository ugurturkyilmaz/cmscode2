## Generated Files
##

    #
    # For the most part, these are artifacts of our installation and build
    # processes and exist only as untracked files. A small number are committed
    # to the repository, but as they are generated files the linter should not
    # touch them.
    #
    *.soy.js
    build/**
    classes/**
    css/clay/**

##
## Template Files
##

    #
    # These files define the copyright headers the linter should add to any file
    # that does not have them. In order to produce the desired result when
    # prepended, each must have a trailing blank line. Prettier would remove the
    # blank line if we did not ignore it here.
    #
    /copyright.js
    /dxp/copyright.js

##
## Sample Files
##

    #
    # These files are empty, apart from copyright headers, which means that we
    # need to ignore them to prevent Prettier from stripping off the trailing
    # blank line.
