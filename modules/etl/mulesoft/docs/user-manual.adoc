= Liferay Connector

== Overview
The Anypoint Liferay Connector connects Liferay to other platforms and services
in the Mulesoft ecosystem.

Here, you'll learn how the Liferay connector is designed, as well as how to use it to set up
and configure a basic flow. 

== Prerequisites
You should be familiar already with Mule and Anypoint Studio. To learn about
Studio, consider completing an Anypoint Studio Tutorial. You should know about
Mule Concepts, Elements in a Mule Flow, and Global Elements.

For connector prerequisites, check link:release-notes.adoc[release notes].

== Liferay Connector Design
Liferay Connector is dynamically configured using OpenAPI 3.0 documents that
describe all Liferay APIs at https://app.swaggerhub.com/organizations/liferayinc[Swagger Hub]

Each OpenAPI document is also deployed dynamically in your Liferay Portal
instance under the following schema:
....
http://[host]:[port]/o/[headless-api-app-name]/[version]/openapi.json
....

This OpenAPI document is dynamically generated based on your deployed RESTful
web services, so it is the most current and accurate description of your APIs.
More about Liferay APIs can be found
https://portal.liferay.dev/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/get-started-discover-the-api[here].

Once you specify an OpenAPI document endpoint, Liferay Connector is dynamically
configured with paths, path/query parameters and entity metadata defined in the
OpenAPI document.

Liferay Connector works with any OpenAPI 3.0 document that follows Liferay
standards and supports all Liferay APIs.

== Connector Configuration
To configure the Liferay Connector, you must

. Select an authentication method and enter required authentication parameters
. Specify an OpenAPI document endpoint

Choose between *Basic* and *OAuth2* authentication methods.
Read more about authentication methods
https://portal.liferay.dev/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/making-authenticated-requests[here].

Basic Authentication::
Enter a *User name* and *Password*.

OAuth2::
* Enter a *Client Key* and *Client Secret*.

You must set up OAuth2 authorization in your Liferay instance first by following
the instructions
https://portal.liferay.dev/docs/7-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/oauth-2-0#creating-an-application[here].
Liferay supports the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials grant type. Select *Headless
Server* for the Client Profile.

Liferay generates a Client ID (*Consumer Key*) and Client Secret (*Consumer Secret*)
to use in your Liferay Connector configuration. Before you can start
using endpoints with OAuth2 authorization you must also enable
https://portal.liferay.dev/docs/7-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/oauth2-scopes[scopes].
Select the desired scope and check authorization options you need, such as
_everything_, _everything.write_ or _everything.read_.

Specify OpenAPI Document::
Once authorized, you can specify the Liferay API you want to use. Specify the
OpenAPI document endpoint that describes the API you want. For example, the
Commerce Admin Catalog API is here:

http://[host]:[port]/o/headless-commerce-admin-catalog/v1.0/openapi.json

Enter it into the
*OpenAPI Spec URL* field. [%hardbreaks]

* Configuration example using Basic authentication

```xml
 <liferay:config name="Liferay_Config_Catalog">
 <liferay:basic-connection username=${username} password=${password} openApiSpecPath="http://localhost:8080/o/headless-commerce-admin-catalog/v1.0/openapi.json" />
 </liferay:config>
```

* Configuration example using OAuth 2.0
```xml
 <liferay:config name="Liferay_Config_Catalog">
    <liferay:oauth2-connection consumerKey="${consumerKey}" consumerSecret=${consumerSecret} openApiSpecPath="http://localhost:8080/o/headless-commerce-admin-catalog/v1.0/openapi.json" />
 </liferay:config>
```

If *Test Connection* is successful, you can start building flows using the
Liferay Connector!

== Operations
Now that you've created your Mule project and imported and configured the
Liferay Connector, you can build your Mule flows using Liferay Connector
operations. Operations *Create Records*, *Delete Records*, *Get Records*, and
*Update Records* resources defined by your OpenAPI document. Each operation
implements and exposes different parts of the specified OpenAPI document.

If you're working with large data sets, you probably don't want to handle every
single record one at the time. This is where Liferay Batch operations come into
play. They enable you to submit large amount of data to be processed in batch by
the Liferay instance, which results in much faster execution time.

=== Create Records Operation

Create exposes all endpoints that are manipulated by HTTP POST.

The SwaggerHub UI shows all available path parameters, request body
structures, and all possible responses.

image::swaggerhub_products_post.png[The "/products" endpoint creates a new product using HTTP POST.]

Once you select desired endpoint from the Endpoint selector the connector
dynamically generates related metadata.

image::anypoint_studio_products_create.png[The same endpoint is used in a flow that imports products from Salesforce into Liferay Commerce. ]

Next, you define input parameters. Input parameters support all Liferay RESTful
web services and need not be used with every endpoint:

[%header,cols=4*]
|===
|Parameter name
|Type
|Description
|Required

|Endpoint
|String
|Drop-down list of available endpoints that support create operation
|Yes

|Records
|Object
|Object to be created
|Yes

|Path Params
|Object
|Map with path parameter values
|Yes (if required by endpoint)

|Query Params
|Object
|Map with query parameter values
|No
|===

Use https://app.swaggerhub.com/organizations/liferayinc as documentation for 
Liferay Connector operations.
You can also use the OpenAPI document from the endpoint you defined in
connector configuration, in which case you lose the helpful UI offered by
SwaggerHub editor.

=== Batch Export Operation
The Batch Export operation allows you to get all records of a specified entity
with a single request.

image::anypoint_studio_products_export.png[Batch export operation example]

To configure a Batch export operation, first select the entity you want to export
using the Class name drop-down list. 
Once selected, the connector dynamically generates related output metadata.
If desired, you can use the Field names input to specify which fields are 
included in the exported entity.
Field names should be separated using commas.
You can also specify a Site ID parameter if it is required by the batch
processing logic.

[%header,cols=4*]
|===
| Parameter name
| Type
| Description
| Required

| Class name
| String
| Entity that will be exported
| Yes

| Site id
| String
| siteId query parameter
| No

| Field names
| String
| Comma separated list of entity fields that will be exported
| No

|===

Running this flow will result in a JSON array of Products ready
to be transformed and loaded into another system.

=== Batch Import Operations
There are three types of Batch import operations: Create, Delete and Update. 
Each type of operation imports a set of entities, though they're processed
differently by the Liferay instance batch engine.
The following example shows a Batch Import Create operation.

image::anypoint_studio_products_import.png[Batch import operation example]

Similar to configuring Batch exports, first use the Class name drop-down list 
to select the entity you want to import. 
Once selected, the connector dynamically generates related input metadata.
Then, use the Record field to submit a JSON array of entity objects .

If desired, use the Field name mappings drop-down list to map field names between
related entities from different systems. If you've used the Transform Message module
to map entity fields between source and destination systems, you can leave this
field empty.

[%header,cols=4*]
|===
| Parameter name
| Type
| Description
| Required

| Class name
| String
| Entity that will be imported
| Yes

| Field name mappings
| Object
| Map with field name mapping definitions
| No

| Records
| Object
| JSON array of entity objects
| Yes
