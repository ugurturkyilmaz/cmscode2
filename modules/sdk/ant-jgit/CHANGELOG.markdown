## 1.0.3 - 2015-05-28

### Commits
- [LPS-55937] this may be used outside (531c9efcbf)
- [LPS-55937] Turn on task level result caching, assuming repository does not
change during build. (34bf12df05)
- [LPS-55937] Change the head hash logic to be: 1) If there is no ignore file,
just use the first hash under this dir. 2) If there is an ignore file, and the
first hash does not contain the ignore file, use the first hash. 3) If there is
an ignore file, and the first hash contains the ignore file, use the second hash
if it exist (regardless whether the second hash contains the ignore file or not)
4) If there is an ignore file, and the first hash contains the ignore file, but
the second hash does not exist, fallback to use the first hash, even it does
contain the ignore file. (This is ensuring the build script can always get a
hash value in order to continue running) (57bad010d0)
- [LPS-55937] The git repos does not change during build, there is no point to
recreate the dir cache on every call to get status. Let's cache it to save the
massive IO operations. (4edae571eb)
- [LPS-55937] Since we don't use git submodule at all, let's ignore it to speed
things up. (36716e688a)
