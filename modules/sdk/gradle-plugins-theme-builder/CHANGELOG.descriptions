2.0.2:description

- [LPS-72367] Automatically add the latest release of the
[Liferay Frontend Theme Classic] artifact to the `parentThemes` configuration.
- [LPS-72367] Change the sensible default of the `buildTheme` task's
`parentFile` property so it's possible to use WAR parent themes from the
`parentThemes` configuration.

2.0.0:description

- [LPS-66396] The `buildTheme` task now writes its output files in a temporary
directory, so the generated files are no longer mixed with source files.
- [LPS-66396] The `diffsDir` property of the `buildTheme` task now points
directly to `project.webAppDir`, which means that all the files contained in
that directory (by default, `src/main/webapp`) are copied over the parent theme
(if specified) and included in the WAR file.
- [LPS-66396] The `parentDir` and `unstyledDir` properties of `BuildThemeTask`
now only support directories as input. In order to point these properties to a
file, use the `parentFile` and `unstyledFile` properties, respectively.
- [LPS-66396] Include only the compiled CSS files, and not SCSS files, into
the WAR file.
- [LPS-66396] Remove the `outputThemeDirs` property of the `BuildThemeTask`.
