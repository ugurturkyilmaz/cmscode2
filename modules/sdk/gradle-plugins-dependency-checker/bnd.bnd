Bundle-Description: The Dependency Checker Gradle plugin lets you warn users if a specific configuration dependency is not the latest one available from the Maven central repository. The plugin eventually fails the build if the dependency age (the difference between the timestamp of the current version and the latest version) is above a predetermined threshold.
