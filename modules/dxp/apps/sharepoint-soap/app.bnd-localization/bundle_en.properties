liferay-releng-app-description=The Liferay SOAP Connector for SharePoint app lets users interact with files in SharePoint libraries from within a Liferay Documents and Media library. This app makes available in the Documents and Media Library a SharePoint repository type for mounting SharePoint libraries.
