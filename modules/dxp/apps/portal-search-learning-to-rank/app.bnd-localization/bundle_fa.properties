Install a plugin to Elasticsearch, install this application to Liferay DXP, mix in a bit of data science, and you can point Liferay search queries at a trained Learning to Rank model that you've uploaded to the Elasticsearch plugin. Your Liferay queries are re-scored by the AI-trained model to produce better search results for your Liferay DXP end users.<br />To learn about compatibility, see the compatibility matrix: https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016511651#Liferay-Enterprise-Search.
