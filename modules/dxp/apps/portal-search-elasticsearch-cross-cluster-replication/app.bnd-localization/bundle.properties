liferay-releng-app-description=The ${liferay.releng.app.title.prefix} Enterprise Search Cross-Cluster Replication app lets you perform read operations from a local cluster that has been configured to replicate, or follow, the indices of a remote cluster. The local cluster containing the replicated indices must be configured manually before this app can execute requests against it. You can find more information about Cross-Cluster Replication at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/xpack-ccr.html.<br />To learn about compatibility, see the compatibility matrix: https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016511651#Liferay-Enterprise-Search.
