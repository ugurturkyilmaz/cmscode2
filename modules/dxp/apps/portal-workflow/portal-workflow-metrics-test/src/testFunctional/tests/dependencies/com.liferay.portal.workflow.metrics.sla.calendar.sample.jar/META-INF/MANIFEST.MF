Liferay-Releng-Suite-Description: Apps and Features: Calendar, Dynamic
  Data Lists, Dynamic Data Mapping, Forms, Polls, Workflow<br /><br />
 An increase in productivity means you're saving time and effort; youâ
 €™re becoming more efficient. The Forms and Workflow apps help you do
  that by giving you built-in calendars and the ability to create your
  own forms and list applications. These are powerful, flexible apps t
 hat can be quickly leveraged for basic tasks, or carefully configured
  and mastered to perfect business processes.<br /><br />Need a quick 
 survey or complex Sign Up form? Use the Liferay Forms app and make an
 y forms you want. If there's a forms feature you need, this app proba
 bly has it.<br /><br />Maybe you need an entire list application, and
  you need it today. Dynamic Data Lists lets you do it without any dev
 eloper expertise.<br /><br />Do you need personal calendars for your 
 users, and/or site calendars? Do you need the calendar to be highly c
 onfigurable? Use the Calendar app.<br /><br />Would you like to initi
 ate a review process when new content, or any new asset, is created? 
 The Kaleo Workflow Engine lets you send any asset through review befo
 re it gets published.<br /><br />Want to quickly get the opinion of y
 our users on something? The Polls app is extremely easy to use.<br />
 <br />This suite may contain modules that depend on Foundation suite 
 modules. This suite is available in the Liferay bundle.
