# How to Contribute

Liferay Portal is developed by its community consisting of users, enthusiasts,
employees, customers, partners, and others. We strongly encourage you to
contribute to Liferay's open source projects by implementing new features,
enhancing existing features, and fixing bugs. We also welcome your participation
in our forums, chat, writing documentation, and translating existing
documentation.

Liferay Portal is known for its innovative top quality features. To maintain
this reputation, all code changes are reviewed by a core set of project
maintainers. We encourage you to join our
[Slack Chat](https://communitychat.liferay.com/) and introduce yourself to the
core maintainer(s) and engage them as you contribute to the areas they maintain.

To get a deeper understanding of Liferay Portal in general, make sure to read
